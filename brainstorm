Problems:
    - Representation of the board
        * Multi-dimesional array (push symbols onto appropriate squares)
        * Hash with each position of square as key and the square as the value
    - Specifying terms of victory
        * Three of the same symbol are in adjacent "quadrants" (define adjacent? or )
    - Specifying end of game as draw
        * All numbers are letters and no terms of victory are met.
    - Filled spaces must be immutable
        * If number is in quadrant, switch it; if letter is in quadrant, return "Try again"
    - Intuitive gameplay
        * Numbers in each nonant, replaced by symbol
        * "X:" prompt, numerical input

Questions
    - Does victory and draw all go into game_over? or are they separate methods?
    - How to insert multiline string into array? (join with boxes as the argument? Does #join have multiline string capabilities?)
    - How to print a multidimensional array maintaining rows and columns?
